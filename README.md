# Lesson 11: Advection of Earth's surface
This week we encounter our second common geoscience equation, the advection equation.
Similar to last week, we will start with a [short lecture](Lesson/) about the advection equation and its application to modelling river erosion.
There are also [some notes](Lesson/) posted for how to solve the advection-diffusion equation.
These are not required reading, but may be of interest for the exercise this week.
As usual we will finish with the [exercise for this week]().
